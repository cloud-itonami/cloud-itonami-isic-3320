(ns installation.notify
  "Mail + phone transport SEAM for the SAFETY-CONCERN NOTICE this actor
  sends once a human has approved committing a `:flag-safety-concern`
  proposal -- the concrete 呼びかけ／共有 (outreach/sharing) deliverable,
  the industrial-machinery-installation-domain analog of `demolition.
  notify`/`construction.notify`.

  `Notifier` is the injection seam: `mock-notifier` (deterministic, no
  network -- the default, and the ONLY implementation shipped by this
  repo) for dev/tests/demo. `dispatch-safety-concern-notice!` fans the
  SAME notice out to every contact in a site's `:safety-contacts` roster
  (the licensed engineer / site supervisor, NOT installation crew -- this
  actor coordinates, it does not warn a workforce about an in-progress
  hazard) over BOTH channels, isolating one contact's send failure from
  every other contact's.

  UNLIKE this repo's `demolition`/`construction` siblings (which also
  ship real `java.net.http`-backed Resend/Twilio transports guarded by
  `#?(:clj ...)`), this repo deliberately ships NO JVM-only interop
  anywhere in `src/` -- see this workspace's cljs-first `.cljc` runtime-
  priority rule (CLAUDE.md `.cljc`/`.kotoba` runtime priority section:
  `kotoba wasm` > `clojurewasm` > `ClojureScript` > `nbb`, JVM/`bb`
  downgraded to a last resort) and this build's explicit no-JVM-interop
  mandate. A real transport (Resend mail / Twilio voice, or an
  equivalent) can be added later behind the SAME `Notifier` protocol via
  a portable HTTP client (e.g. a `cljs`/`nbb` `fetch`-based
  implementation) without changing this namespace's shape or any caller
  -- until then, this actor's safety-concern notice is 'sent' only via
  the deterministic mock, and callers that need a real send must supply
  their own `Notifier` implementation.

  `:flag-safety-concern` is NEVER fired by an auto-commit -- it always
  escalates to a human first (see `installation.phase`/`installation.
  governor` ns docstrings), so by the time `installation.operation`'s
  `:commit` node calls this, a human has already reviewed the concern.
  This namespace builds/sends the message; it does NOT decide whether to
  send one."
